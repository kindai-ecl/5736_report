  ABSTRACT = {This paper proposes a deep learning algorithm that can improve pill identification performance using limited training data. In general, when individual pills are detected in multiple pill images, the algorithm uses multiple pill images from the learning stage. However, when there is an increase in the number of pill types to be identified, the pill combinations in an image increase exponentially. To detect individual pills in an image that contains multiple pills, we first propose an effective database expansion method for a single pill. Then, the expanded training data are used to improve the detection performance. Our proposed method shows higher performance improvement than the existing algorithms despite the limited imaging and data set size. Our proposed method will help minimize problems, such as loss of productivity and human error, which occur while inspecting dispensed pills.},
